# Plain News

This is my first school assignment as a web developer at YRGO, with the goal of creating a news feed with fake news articles. Built with PHP, SQLite, HTML and CSS.

## Installation

Clone or fork this repo and start a PHP server in your terminal by entering:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

## Testers

* Erik Johannesson
* Henrik Björkvall

## Code Review

- ~~index.php - On line 10: Use line breaks on each SQL statement to make your code more readable.~~

- This is just a minor issue but since you’re just using two icons from fontawesome, maybe it would be better if you load them directly in the HTML, the icons load last which makes their positions empty for a small amount of time.

- ~~Don’t forget your semicolons after each echo.~~

- ~~Optional: If you want your image to stay in the same position when changing media queries, you could add an object-position.~~

- ~~functions.php - Don’t forget to add your parameters in the docblock.~~
